Max_cycle.java --> Problem Description :- Largest Sum Cycle Given a maze with N cells. Each cell may have multiple entry points but not more than one exit(i.e entry/exit points are unidirectional doors like valves).

min_coin.java --> Given an array coins[] of size N and a target value V, where coins[i] represents the coins of different denominations. You have an infinite supply of each of coins. The task is to find minimum number of coins required to make the given value V. If itâ€™s not possible to make a change, print -1.

meeting_point.java --> Problem Description : You are given a maze with N cells. Each cell may have multiple entry points but not more than one exit (i.e. entry/exit points are unidirectional doors like valves). The cells are named with an integer from 0 to N-1.

start_and_distination.java --> This problem asks you to check for a given static graph if a node dest is reachable from a given node src .

Depth_of_forest.java --> The depth of forest at which maximum number of nodes are present. N can be very large. Aim for an algorithm with a time complexity of O(N).

Max_sum_cycle.java -->  Given the graph, Print out the maximum weight Cycle of the graph. ( Cycle which has maximum sum weight )

max_sum_node.java --> Problem Description : You are given a maze with N cells. Each cell may have multiple entry points but not more than one exit (i.e. entry/exit points are unidirectional doors like valves).
